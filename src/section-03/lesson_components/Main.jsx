  /**
   * Challenge: Get a recipe from the AI!
   * 
   * This will be a bit harder of a challenge that will require you
   * to think critically and synthesize the skills you've been
   * learning and practicing up to this point.
   * 
   * We'll start with a mini-quiz:
   * 
   * 1. Think about where the recipe response should live and how you're
   *    going to make sure it doesn't disappear between each state change in
   *    the app. (I don't mean between refreshes of your mini-browser.
   *    You don't need to save this to localStorage or anything more permanent
   *    than in React's memory for now.)
   *  - save response in react state
   * 
   * 2. What action from the user should trigger getting the recipe?
   *  - when the button to get recipe is clicked
